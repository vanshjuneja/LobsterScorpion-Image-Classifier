# LobsterScorpion-Image-Classifier
This is a Machine Learning model built with the Fast.Ai computer vision library based on PyTorch using Python 3.7. It uses the ResNet-34 neural net architecture, trained with a data bunch  containing a training set of ~320 images and a validation set of ~80 images, to predict whether an image displays a tasty lobster or a scary venomous scorpion.
